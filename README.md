# AI Risk Monitor — Continuous Model Assurance

A **Streamlit dashboard** for continuous AI model assurance, combining **real-time prediction**, **drift monitoring**, and **AI governance compliance mapping**.  
This project aligns with **ISO/IEC 42001**, **NIST AI RMF 1.0**, and **GDPR Article 22**, making it a practical tool for **Responsible AI & Risk Governance**.

##  Features

**Predict Risk (Demo)**  
- Input features manually or upload a CSV file.  
- Predict “Risk” vs “No Risk” using a trained ML pipeline.  

 **Risk Register & Drift Monitoring**  
- Live predictions are logged for drift analysis.  
- RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status shows when risk or drift is detected.  
- Risk Register is auto-exported as `risk_register.csv`.  

**Compliance Mapping (Read-only)**  
- **ISO/IEC 42001** → Risk assessment, controls, monitoring, improvements.  
- **NIST AI RMF** → Map, Measure, Manage AI risks.  
- **GDPR Article 22** → Human oversight, transparency in automated decision-making.
